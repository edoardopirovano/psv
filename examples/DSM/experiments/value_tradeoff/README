The directory structure is as follows:

- Folder "no-dsm" contains DTMC models of sizes 2 to 7 agents where there is no demand-side management employed (i.e., agent always executes a task if one arrives). Model file mdsmX3X4.prism contains the model of X agents and the property to model-check the value is in the respective mdsmX3X4.props file. The value returned by the model checker has to be divided by the number of agents in the model (i.e., X) to obtain the value of the dotted line from the graph in Figure 2a in [CFK+12] and Figure 4a in [CFK+13b].

- Folder "original" contains DTMC models of sizes 2 to 7 agents where the demand-side management algorithm of [SS11] is employed. Model file mdsmX3X4.prism contains the model of X agents and the property to model-check the value is in the respective mdsmX3X4.props file. The value returned by the model checker has to be divided by the number of agents in the model (i.e., X) to obtain the value of the bold line from the graphs in Figure 2 in [CFK+12] and Figure 4 in [CFK+13b].

- Folder "no-punishment" contains SMG models of sizes 2 to 7 agents where the demand-side management algorithm of [SS11] is modified to allow agent to choose whether its dopts the algorithm or deviates and chooses to execute the task irrespective if the current load. Model file mdsmX304.prism contains the model of X agents and the rPATL properties to model-check the values for different coalition sizes are in the respective mdsmX304.props file. The value returned by the model checker has to be divided by the number of agents in the coalition to obtain the value of the horizontal line for the respective model and coalition sizes line from the graph in Figure 2a in [CFK+12] and Figure 4a in [CFK+13b].

- Folder "with-punishment" contains SMG models of sizes 2 to 7 agents where the models from "no-punishment' are modified to allows the distribution manager to cancel a one job per timestep. Model file mdsmX3Y4p.prism contains the model of X agents Y of which are executing the "original" algorithm and the remaining are allowed to deviate. The rPATL property to model-check the value is in the respective mdsmX3Y4.props file. The value returned by the model checker has to be divided by the number of agents in the coalition to obtain the value of the horizontal line for the respective model and coalition sizes line from the graph in Figure 2b in [CFK+12] and Figure 4b in [CFK+13b].

In addition each folder contains a script run-all.sh which will model-check all properties in the folder and output the results into *.res file.
