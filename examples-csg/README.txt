Concurrent game models:

 - Rock-paper-scissors: directory "rps"

 - Future markets investors: directory "investor" and "two_investors"

 - User-centric networks: directory "trust"

 - Intrusion detection system: directory "ids"

 - Jamming radio systems: directory "jamming"

Each directory includes an auto.sh script, showing how the examples run

When generating an optimal strategy both a text file (adv.tra) and a graphical representation (adv.dot) are generated. This lists the optimal choices of the coalition for all possible choices of the remaining players. The .dot file can be viewed using the graphviz visualisation software (https://www.graphviz.org).
