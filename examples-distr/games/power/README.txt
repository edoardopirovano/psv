This case study is based on [BKTW15] and is concerned with synthesis of strategies for power regulation in a more electric aircraft.

We model the two high-voltage AC components of the patent [Mich08] as stochastic games, and synthesise a local strategy for each component. An earlier treatment of the topic using LTL synthesis can be found in [XTM12].
